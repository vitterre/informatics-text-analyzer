There was a moment I had an insomnia. I wasn't prone to it. I had it like 5 days in a row. I couldn't sleep.
After that, I met one guy and helped him with money. When I wasn't able to make my school project and pull my
weight in it I asked him if he could help.
By the way, that guy had very interesting moral foundation based on nonconformism and denying the materialistic
thoughts of "average 21st century fake man". He was always standing up for his principles. He helped me and the
asked me one thing. He said: "I want you to hit me as hard as you can". I did it and then we fought. After that
we really hitted it off.
A felt freedom. I stopped being bothered of any problems. I became pretty laid-back and lighten up person. His
mind was my line manager. He confided me that he hates frailness. Our society likes frailness.
All my thoughts were assembled because we were seeing an eye to eye with each other. I was fighting against all
my bad habbits and the weakness that a lof people have now.
I never had been telling about this guy anyone. He asked me don't do it. But once I told about it my classmate.
After that I have never seen him. I missed myself like old people miss their houses that were blasted in order
to build a skykeeper on their places.
Then I remembered he was communicating with one girl I once saw. I found her and told about her. She said I'm
crazy. He called me by his name. Every time. I was shocked by it. Then I finally understood the situation. He
didn't exist. I did it while I was already walking on Bauman st. And there was a guy who was playing a cover of
"Pixies - Where is my mind".
Then Chuck Palanik wrote a book about it.
